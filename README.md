# L3-Internship-QW-Gravitons
My L3 Internship was accomplished in June-July 2019, under the supervision of Pablo Arrighi.

This folder will give you examples of the coded QCA (Quantum Cellular Automatas).

Oaxaca.py is the first toy walk that I coded. It features the Dirac Walk, as described in this video from P. Arrighi in Oaxaca:

qw1x.ml is the first Black-hole walk. It is an all-classical random walk on the 1+1D lattice.

The folders "stage 2" and "stage 3" refer respectively to the Hybrid walk (with classical gravitons) and the full quantum QCA interaction of two particles.

More to follow !
