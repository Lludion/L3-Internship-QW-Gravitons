# L3-Internship-QW-Gravitons
My L3 Internship was accomplished in June-July 2019, under the supervision of Pablo Arrighi.

This folder will give you examples of the coded QCA (Quantum Cellular Automatas).

## Previous works
Oaxaca.py is the first toy walk that I coded. It features the Dirac Walk, as described in [this video from P. Arrighi in Oaxaca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWrKRfy-2Wk):

## First implementation : Classical Walk
qw1x.ml is the first Black-hole walk. It is an all-classical random walk on the 1+1D lattice.

To test it, all you have to do is execute the python file : plot.py.

## Second implementation : Hybrid Walk
The folders "stage 2" and "stage 3" refer respectively to the Hybrid walk (with classical gravitons) and the full quantum QCA interaction of two particles.

## Third implementation : Interaction of two quantum particles
(With quantum gravitons)
